## 1 DevOps Strategic View

A compound of development (Dev) and operations (Ops), DevOps is the union of people, processes and technology to continually provide value to customers. DevOps enables formerly siloed roles – development, IT operations, quality engineering and security – to coordinate and collaborate to produce better, more reliable products. By adopting a DevOps culture along with DevOps practices and tools, teams gain the ability to better respond to customer needs, increase confidence in the applications they build and achieve business goals faster.

## 2 Monitoring on Azure

Distributed applications and services running in the cloud are, by their nature, complex pieces of software that comprise many moving parts. In a production environment, it's important to be able to track the way in which users use your system, trace resource utilization, and generally monitor the health and performance of your system. You can use this information as a diagnostic aid to detect and correct issues, and also to help spot potential problems and prevent them from occurring.
